* **INFOBOX MODULE (avt.InfoBox)** - This is the management InfoBox Module. Note that this module is recommended to be placed only on one page, usually a page created special for Administrators to configure the module. Using this module you can manage all the things that InfoBox can provide, from creation and administration of the Guide to custom generated reports.
Once this module is placed inside a page, you can start adding your first Guide using the following step-by-step tutorial found below ;

If user clicks on a guide placed in this menu, he will be redirected to the first step of the guide (if workflow is set to reset) or to continue from the last triggered step (if workflow is set to continue).
